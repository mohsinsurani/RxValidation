# RxValidation

RxValidation is a workspace made using RxSwift, RxCocoa & RxRelays. As Variables are depreciated, Relays came into picture. This Simple Reactive Validation will help to organize and standardize the code in more readable manner. Validation protocols have been used in this demo so use an advantage as an abstraction layer.

## Installation
